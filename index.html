        <h2>Where to Eat</h2>
        <p>This is not the aspirational fluff of Instagram wall neon; it's fact.
            Recent surveys have shown that a majority of travelers
            consider food first when planning a trip, even ahead of
            where they sleep. Add to this that people are also traveling more than
            ever before - earthlings logged a record breaking 1.4 billion
            international trips last year - and it's safe to say that the hunger
            for new culinary experiences is more ravenous than ever.
        </p>
        <p>While the endlessly alluring bistros of Paris, izakayas of Tokyo, shawarma
            stands of Tel Aviv, and tasting menus of Mexico City will always top many
            people's lists of cravings, we're continually on the lookout for something
            new to fill our bellies, our passports, and our feeds.
